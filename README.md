## Task 1
Create an React app that will have a select containing this values: `http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone`

After selecting time zone, the user will see the current time at these places e.g. after selecting “Asia/Yekaterinburg” you need to fetch
`https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Asia/Yekaterinburg`
and show it to the user.

-> (what interests us is only nice formatted datetime).
Please make sure that the shown value is refreshed every 5s (you will need to use setInterval for these).
